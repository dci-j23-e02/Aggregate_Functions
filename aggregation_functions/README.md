These queries are designed to provide insights into different aspects of the database, such as event attendance, ticket sales, and review ratings.

### 1. AVG() - Average Function

**Question:** What is the average capacity of venues?

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT AVG(capacity) AS average_capacity
FROM venues;
```

### 2. COUNT() - Count Function

**Question:** How many events are scheduled for each organizer?

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT organizer_id, COUNT(event_id) AS events_count
FROM events
GROUP BY organizer_id;
```

### 3. MAX() - Maximum Function

**Question:** What is the maximum price of tickets sold across all events?

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT MAX(price) AS max_ticket_price
FROM tickets;
```

### 4. MIN() - Minimum Function

**Question:** What is the minimum rating given to any event in reviews?

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT MIN(rating) AS min_rating
FROM reviews;
```

### 5. SUM() - Sum Function

**Question:** What is the total revenue generated from ticket sales for a specific event?

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT event_id, SUM(price) AS total_revenue
FROM tickets
WHERE event_id = 'specific-event-uuid' -- Replace 'specific-event-uuid' with the actual event UUID
GROUP BY event_id;
```

### 6. ROUND() - Round Function

**Question:** What is the average rating for each event, rounded to 2 decimal places?

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT event_id, ROUND(AVG(rating::numeric), 2) AS average_rating
FROM reviews
GROUP BY event_id;
```
Note: Assuming `rating` is stored as an ENUM or TEXT, you might need to convert it to a numeric value for averaging, depending on your schema design.

### Corrected Query for Average Rating

```sql
SELECT event_id, 
       ROUND(AVG(CASE rating 
                     WHEN 'poor' THEN 1
                     WHEN 'fair' THEN 2
                     WHEN 'good' THEN 3
                     WHEN 'excellent' THEN 4
                     ELSE NULL
                 END), 2) AS average_rating
FROM reviews
GROUP BY event_id;
```

### Explanation

- **CASE Statement**: This part of the query maps each `rating` enum value to a numeric score (`1` for 'poor', `2` for 'fair', etc.). This conversion allows PostgreSQL to calculate an average since the scores are numeric.
- **AVG() Function**: Calculates the average of the numeric scores assigned to each rating.
- **ROUND() Function**: Rounds the average rating to 2 decimal places for readability.
- **GROUP BY event_id**: This groups the results by `event_id`, ensuring that the average rating is calculated separately for each event.

This approach circumvents the direct casting issue by manually defining how each enum value should be interpreted numerically. It's a common pattern when dealing with enum types that need to be used in numeric calculations or comparisons.

### 7. GROUP BY - Group By Clause

**Question:** How many tickets have been sold for each ticket status (available, sold, reserved) per event?

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT event_id, status, COUNT(ticket_id) AS tickets_count
FROM tickets
GROUP BY event_id, status;
```

### 8. HAVING - Having Clause

**Question:** Which events have an average rating higher than 4?

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT event_id
FROM reviews
GROUP BY event_id
HAVING AVG(rating::numeric) > 4; -- Assuming rating can be converted to numeric
```

These queries demonstrate how to use various SQL aggregation functions to extract meaningful information from the Events Scheduling database. Remember to adjust field names and data types according to your specific database schema.
